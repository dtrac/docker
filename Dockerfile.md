# Dockerfile basics

The Dockerfile is a set of instructions used to build container images, including:

- Filesystem and directory structure layout
- Copying of binaries and configuration
- Installation of pre-reqs, packages, libraries or software
- Running any custom set-up commands
- Setting environment variables
- Defining the command/executable to start the application
